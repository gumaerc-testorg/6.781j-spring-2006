## Recommended Reading

Feynman, Richard P. "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom." *Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems* 1 (1992): 60-66.

A reprint of Feynman's original "There's plenty of room at the bottom" speech, given in 1959. This talk is considered to have been the start of the field of nanotechnology research, although, as you will learn if you read the article by Buck and Shoulders, others had visions that were more realistic, if less grandiose than Feynman's.

Buck, D. A., and K. R. Shoulders. "An Approach to Microminiature Printed Systems." *Eastern Joint Computer Conference* (July 1959): 55-59.

Buck and Shoulders provide a vision for microelectronic fabrication and nanofabrication that closely predicts the route historically taken.

Heinrich, A. J., C. P. Lutz, J. A. Gupta, and D. M. Eigler. "Molecule Cascades." *Science* 298 (2002): 1381-7.

This paper summarizes the STM-based computing scheme that was mentioned (but not presented) in the first lecture. This is simply included for those students who are interested in learning about it.
